        <h1> Personal Digital Data </h1>
        <p>
          For an entire week, I kept an interactive log of all the music I listened to, added, skipped, and created on Spotify.
          I payed particular attention to the way Spotify used algorithms to create individualized content for its users.
          I also wanted to trace my mood when I partook in certain actions and my mood variations between different genres. 
          of the application I used, how long I listened, where I listened, and
          After recording all the data for a week, I turned my data into a sketched out visualization.</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This data collection opened my eyes to how frequently I listened to music and particularly how frequently I used Spotify to do so. 
          Tracking the different elements of Spotify and how often they were used showed me how powerful this music application really was.
          I wanted to pay a lot of attention to the Discover Weekly tool. Discover Weekly created a personalized playlist each each for all 
          of the users of the application. Spotify uses different algorithms and pays close attention to listening habits in order 
          to generate playlists tailored to different music preferences. 
        </p>
        <p>
       Discover Weekly has taken the Music Streaming market by storm, 71% of discover weekly listeners save at least one song to their personal 
       playlists each week and 60% of users go on to stream 5-6 of these tracks. 
	   Spotify also has other services like “Play it forward” where Spotify takes your listening habits from the previous year to create a playlist 
	   of tunes they think you will enjoy in the upcoming year and “This year in music” that breaks down your listening habits by gender to show exactly 
	   what kind of music you are into as a user have also been created. Spotify is ahead of the crowd and constantly keeps listeners intrigued through 
	   thoughtful music marketing.

        <p> My observations from my data collection and visualization offered a better insight into how Spotify took the music streaming market 
            into its own hands. The algorithms and constant customers subscriptions keeps Spotify in the lead.

        Regardless of it is the smallest musician in the world with a following of 20 people, Spotify now can find those 20 people and connect the 
        dots between the artist and listener. Discover weekly seeks to benefit the artist and the listener by creating a positive relationship between 
        the two. Not all the tracks discover weekly selects are perfect, but they cut through the clutter of your everyday over listened to music library. 
        This option comes at a time when many people are caught up in the hustle and bustle of their daily lives, dedicating little time to seeking out new 
        music and artists, music marketing teams like Spotify has emerged with the curation tactic. Spotify is saving every song skip, song saved, playlist 
        created or playlist you visited into its system in order to create recommendations tailored to every individual user.
